# Introduction to Neural Networks and Keras
The following series of lectures were designed for the London campus of the Flatiron School Data Science program.

They were delivered in this order with the following objectives:
* [ ] Intro to Neural Nets
* [ ] Intro to Keras
* [ ] Neural Network MVPs
* [ ] Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning


## Objectives
By the end of the lecture students should be able to:

* [ ] Define key concepts such as padding, kernel size and stride
* [ ] Explain how convolutional layers work
* [ ] Explain how pooling layers work
* [ ] Explain why the training loss can often be higher than the validation loss
* [ ] List the expected consequences of adding/eliminating certain layers from a CNN
* [ ] Run a Convolutional Neural Network
* [ ] List best practices when tuning CNNs
* [ ] Tune CNNs to improve performance
* [ ] Visualise the input images as they go through the multiple layers of a CNN
* [ ] Use a pre-trained Neural Network as a base for your CNN
