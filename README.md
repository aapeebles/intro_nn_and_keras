# Convolutional neural networks and Transfer learning


## Objectives
By the end of the lecture students should be able to:

* [ ] Define key concepts such as padding, kernel size and stride
* [ ] Explain how convolutional layers work
* [ ] Explain how pooling layers work
* [ ] Explain why the training loss can often be higher than the validation loss
* [ ] List the expected consequences of adding/eliminating certain layers from a CNN
* [ ] Run a Convolutional Neural Network
* [ ] List best practices when tuning CNNs
* [ ] Tune CNNs to improve performance
* [ ] Visualise the input images as they go through the multiple layers of a CNN
* [ ] Use a pre-trained Neural Network as a base for your CNN
