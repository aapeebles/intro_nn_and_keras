# Introduction to Neural Networks and Keras
The following series of lectures were designed for the London campus of the Flatiron School Data Science program.

They were delivered in this orde:
* [ ] [Intro to Neural Nets](./Intro%20to%20Neural%20Nets.pdf)
* [ ] [Intro to Keras](./intro-to-keras.ipynb)
* [ ] [Neural Network MVPs](./Neural%20Nets%20MVPs.pdf)
* [ ] [Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning](./CNNs.ipynb)


## Learning Objectives for Introduction to Neural Networks
* [ ] To fluently use the vocabulary of neural networks
* [ ] To connect familiar past algorithms to neural networks, and therefore demystify the math 
* [ ] To practice drawing and specifying the parameters of a neural net
* [ ] To list the parameters one can adjust when building a neural net

## Introduction to Keras
* [ ] Hands on practice defining two separate NN
* [ ] Compare pros and cons of Keras vs TensorFlow

## Learning Objectives for Neural Network MVPs
By the end of the lecture students should be able to:
* [ ] Identify how each of the most popular types of NNs is used
* [ ] Know what parameters to optimise in which functions
* [ ] Be aware of the data prep necessary for each type


## Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning Learning Objectives
By the end of the lecture students should be able to:
* [ ] Define key concepts such as padding, kernel size and stride
* [ ] Explain how convolutional layers work
* [ ] Explain how pooling layers work
* [ ] Explain why the training loss can often be higher than the validation loss
* [ ] List the expected consequences of adding/eliminating certain layers from a CNN
* [ ] Run a Convolutional Neural Network
* [ ] List best practices when tuning CNNs
* [ ] Tune CNNs to improve performance
* [ ] Visualise the input images as they go through the multiple layers of a CNN
* [ ] Use a pre-trained Neural Network as a base for your CNN
